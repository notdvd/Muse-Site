                            <p>Formed in Devon, 1994 under the name of <i>Rocket Baby Dolls</i>, Muse came onto the music scene with a lot of talent and ready to showcase it. Performing at local gigs and battle of the bands, they became popular in Devon and Exeter but still unknown elsewhere, releasing a few EPs but nothing solid... until 1999 with the release of their first album <i>Showbiz</i>. The album took off, reaching 29 in the album chart, which saw them start playing more gigs in London and the financial means to continue the band full-time. With increasing success, their second album, <i>Origin of Symmetry</i>, released in 2001, going on to peak at 3rd in the charts, with single <i>Plug in Baby</i> coming in at 11th on the singles chart.</p>

                            <p>6 albums later, Muse have gone on to sell out Wembley multiple times, played all over the globe and all their albums are platinum with multiple number 1 albums and singles. A lot of their success came from their 4th album <i>Black Holes and Revelations</i> in 2006 which saw them finally breakthrough to much larger audiences globally, particularly in the US. They have played at the Olympics and festivals internationally. They continue to push the explored boundaries of music using new digital and acoustic techniques to acomplish a vast range of music argubaly unparalleled by anyone. Featuring on talk shows and events, their global success is undeniable. Having released over 200 songs they show no sign of slowing down with album number 9 in the works and presumably another world tour to be had, already confirming appearances at multiple festivals amidst COVID.</p>
