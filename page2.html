                        <p>Born in Devon on the 9th June 1978, to George Bellamy who was in a band <i>The Tornadoes</i>, he has always been muscial. Trained in flamenco style guitar from an early age he expressed an aptitude for music. Drifting between bands during his teen years, he finally settled with Muse. Matt Bellamy is the Lead Singer, Lead Guitarist, Pianist, Songwriter and Producer for Muse. His eccentric stage tendencies and incredible musicianship have made him the face of 21st Century rock music. Aside from Muse, he has released some of his own music, some for the Simulation Theory Movie and also some of his own covers of Muse and non-Muse songs. He is also part of supergroup <i>The Jaded Hearts Club</i>, a Beatles cover band along with members of Blur, Jet and Paramore. In 2019, he bought Manson Guitar Works, a companny he has used for the majority of his career, to start making his own guitars with the aim of offering high end affordable guitars similar to the more expensive ones he uses.</p>

                        <p>Born on the 2nd December 1978 in Yorkshire but moving to Devon 11 years later, Chris is the Bassist, Rhythm Guitarist, Backup Singer and Harmonicist for Muse. He started on guitar, but was forced to learn drums for an earlier band, then forced by Matt and Dom to learn bass guitar. As the least vocal member of the group he mostly skips interviews, however is the captain of the 'Muse FC' football team for which he organises matches of himself, the crew and his kids against local teams when they are touring. Having struggled with alcoholism, he went to rehab and managed to overcome his addiction, form which he wrote the songs 'Save Me' and 'Liquid State', which are the only two muse songs which are not written or sung by Matt. In 2018, he performed with his own idols, <i>Status Quo</i>. He also owns over 130 guitars.</p>

                        <p>Born in Stockport, Manchester on the 7th December 1977 and moving to Devon aged 8, he grew up completely uninterested in music until high school where he joined jazz band. Moving between the same bands as Matt and Chris, he and Matt eventually started Muse (under the name Gothic Plague). He is the Drummer and Percussionist for Muse, however is the only member of the band who doesn't sing, as he is reportedly completely tone deaf. He once performed in a spiderman costume before which is widely regarded as the best outfit worn ever. Along with Matt he is also a member of <i>The Jaded Hearts Club</i>. Often involved in art design for albums and merchandise, Dom has to regularly replace his drum sets as they are frequently destroyed by Matt and Chris.</p>
